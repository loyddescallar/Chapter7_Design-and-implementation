          <article>
          <p>
            Open source development is an approach to software development in
            which the source code of a software system is published and
            volunteers are invited to participate in the development process
            (Raymond, 2001). Its roots are in the Free Software Foundation
            (http://www.fsf.org), which advocates that source code should not be
            proprietary but rather should always be available for users to
            examine and modify as they wish. There was an assumption that the
            code would be controlled and developed by a small core group, rather
            than users of the code
          </p>

          <p>
            Open source software extended this idea by using the Internet to
            recruit a much larger population of volunteer developers. Many of
            them are also users of the code. In principle at least, any
            contributor to an open source project may report and fix bugs and
            propose new features and functionality. However, in practice,
            successful open source systems still rely on a core group of
            developers who control changes to the software.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best-known open source product is, of course, the Linux
            operating system which is widely used as a server system and,
            increasingly, as a desktop environment. Other important open source
            products are Java, the Apache web server, and the mySQL database
            management system. Major players in the computer industry such as
            IBM and Sun support the open source movement and base their software
            on open source products. There are thousands of other, lesser known
            open source systems and components that may also be used
          </p>

          <p>
            It is usually fairly cheap or free to acquire open source software.
            You can normally download open source software without charge.
            However, if you want documentation and support, then you may have to
            pay for this, but costs are usually fairly low. The other key
            benefit of using open source products is that mature open source
            systems are usually very reliable. The reason for this is that they
            have a large population of users who are willing to fix problems
            themselves rather than report these problems to the developer and
            wait for a new release of the system. Bugs are discovered and
            repaired more quickly than is usually possible with proprietary
            software. For a company involved in software development, there are
            two open source issues that have to be considered:
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          
            <ol>
              1. Should the product that is being developed make use of open
              source components?
            </ol>
            <ol>
              2. Should an open source approach be used for the software’s
              development?
            </ol>
        </article>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            The answers to these questions depend on the type of software that
            is being developed and the background and experience of the
            development team. If you are developing a software product for sale,
            then time to market and reduced costs are critical. If you are
            developing in a domain in which there are high-quality open source
            systems available, you can save time and money by using these
            systems. However, if you are developing software to a specific set
            of organizational requirements, then using open source components
            may not be an option. You may have to integrate your software with
            existing systems that are incompatible with available open source
            systems. Even then, however, it could be quicker and cheaper to
            modify the open source system rather than redevelop the
            functionality that you need.
          </p>

          <p>
            More and more product companies are using an open source approach to
            development. Their business model is not reliant on selling a
            software product but rather on selling support for that product.
            They believe that involving the open source community will allow
            software to be developed more cheaply, more quickly, and will create
            a community of users for the software. Again, however, this is
            really only applicable for general software products rather than
            specific organizational applications. Many companies believe that
            adopting an open source approach will reveal confidential business
            knowledge to their competitors and so are reluctant to adopt this
            development model. However, if you are working in a small company
            and you open source your software, this may reassure customers that
            they will be able to support the software if your company goes out
            of business.
          </p>

          <p>
            Publishing the source code of a system does not mean that people
            from the wider community will necessarily help with its development.
            Most successful open source products have been platform products
            rather than application systems. There are a limited number of
            developers who might be interested in specialized application
            systems. As such, making a software system open source does not
            guarantee community involvement.

        <article>
          

          <p>
            Although a fundamental principle of open-source development is that
            source code should be freely available, this does not mean that
            anyone can do as they wish with that code. Legally, the developer of
            the code (either a company or an individual) still owns the code.
            They can place restrictions on how it is used by including legally
            binding conditions in an open source software license (St. Laurent,
            2004). Some open source developers believe that if an open source
            component is used to develop a new system, then that system should
            also be open source. Others are willing to allow their code to be
            used without this restriction. The developed systems may be
            proprietary and sold as closed source systems. Most open source
            licenses are derived from one of three general models:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <p>
              1. The GNU General Public License (GPL). This is a so-called
              ‘reciprocal’ license that, simplistically, means that if you use
              open source software that is licensed under the GPL license, then
              you must make that software open source
            </p>

            <p>
              2. The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This is a variant
              of the GPL license where you can write components that link to
              open source code without having to publish the source of these
              components. However, if you change the licensed component, then
              you must publish this as open source
            </p>

            <p>
              3. The Berkley Standard Distribution (BSD) License. This is a
              non-reciprocal license, which means you are not obliged to
              republish any changes or modifications made to open source code.
              You can include the code in proprietary systems that are sold. If
              you use open source components, you must acknowledge the original
              creator of the code.
            </p>
          </ol>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>
            Licensing issues are important because if you use open-source
            software as part of a software product, then you may be obliged by
            the terms of the license to make your own product open source. If
            you are trying to sell your software, you may wish to keep it
            secret. This means that you may wish to avoid using GPL-licensed
            open source software in its development.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are building software that runs on an open source platform,
            such as Linux, then licenses are not a problem. However, as soon as
            you start including open source components in your software you need
            to set up processes and databases to keep track of what’s been used
            and their license conditions. Bayersdorfer (2007) suggests that
            companies managing projects that use open source should:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <p>
              1. Establish a system for maintaining information about open
              source components that are downloaded and used. You have to keep a
              copy of the license for each component that was valid at the time
              the component was used. Licenses may change so you need to know
              the conditions that you have agreed to.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. Be aware of the different types of licenses and understand how
              a component is licensed before it is used. You may decide to use a
              component in one system but not in another because you plan to use
              these systems in different ways
            </p>

            <p>3. Be aware of evolution pathways for components. You need to know a bit about
            the open source project where components are developed to understand how
            they might change in future.
            </p>


            <p>4. Educate people about open source. It’s not enough to have procedures in place
            to ensure compliance with license conditions. You also need to educate developers about open source and open source licensing.
            </p>

            <p>5. Have auditing systems in place. Developers, under tight deadlines, might be
            tempted to break the terms of a license. If possible, you should have software in
            place to detect and stop this.</p>

            <p>6. Participate in the open source community. If you rely on open source products,
            you should participate in the community and help support their development.</p>

          </ol>

          <p>The business model of software is changing. It is becoming increasingly difficult
            to build a business by selling specialized software systems. Many companies prefer
            to make their software open source and then sell support and consultancy to software
            users. This trend is likely to accelerate, with increasing use of open source software
            and with more and more software available in this form.
