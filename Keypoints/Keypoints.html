    <h2>Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Software design and implementation are interleaved activities. The level of detail in the design depends on the type of system being developed and whether you are using a plan-driven or agile approach.</li>
      <li>The process of object-oriented design includes activities to design the system architecture, identify objects in the system, describe the design using different object models, and document the component interfaces.</li>
      <li>A range of different models may be produced during an object-oriented design process. These include static models (class models, generalization models, association models) and dynamic models (sequence models, state machine models).</li>
      <li>Component interfaces must be defined precisely so that other objects can use them. A UML interface stereotype may be used to define interfaces.</li>
      <li>When developing software, you should always consider the possibility of reusing existing software, either as components, services, or complete systems.</li>
      <li>Configuration management is the process of managing changes to an evolving software system. It is essential when a team of people are cooperating to develop software.</li>
      <li>Most software development is host-target development. You use an IDE on a host machine to develop the software, which is transferred to a target machine for execution.</li>
      <li>Open source development involves making the source code of a system publicly available. This means that many people can propose changes and improvements to the software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Further Reading</h2>
