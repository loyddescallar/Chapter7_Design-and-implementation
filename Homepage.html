            The objectives of this chapter are to introduce object-oriented
            software design using the UML and highlight important implementation
            concerns. When you have read this chapter, you will:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Understand the most important activities in a general,
              objectoriented design process;
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand some of the different models that may be used to
              document an object-oriented design;
            </li>
            <li>
              Know about the idea of design patterns and how these are a way
              reusing design knowledge and experience;
            </li>
            <li>
              Have been introduced to key issues that have to be considered when
              implementing software, including software reuse and open-source
              development.

            <p class = "Preview">Software design and implementation involves developing a working system by planning its structure and components using object-oriented design to ensure it operates effectively, integrates smoothly with other systems, and remains easy to develop, update, and manage.</p>

            <p class = "Preview">Design patterns are reusable ideas that solve common software design problems by providing proven solutions and examples, helping developers build systems that are flexible, efficient, and easy to understand and maintain.</p>

            <div class = "cntns"><p><b class = "txtbold">7.3  Implementation issues</b></p>
            <p class = "Preview">Software implementation involves creating an executable system through reuse of existing software, configuration management to control changes, and host-target development to ensure the software runs correctly on its intended platform.</p>

            <div class = "cntns"><p><b class = "txtbold">7.4 Open source development</b></p>
            <p class = "Preview">Open source development is a software approach where source code is made publicly available for anyone to use, modify, and improve, encouraging collaboration and faster innovation while raising licensing, control, and business model considerations.</p>

            <a href="Key-Points.html">Software design and implementation happen together, and the amount of planning depends on the system and development method. Object-oriented design involves planning the system’s structure, finding main objects, and showing how they work together using diagrams. Clear interfaces help different parts of the program connect properly. Developers should reuse existing software when possible and use configuration management to handle changes in team projects. Most software is developed on one computer and run on another. Open source development lets others see and improve the code.
